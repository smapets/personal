                                <p>As a Structural Engineer Graduate with a MSc. in Earthquake Engineering, I have already gained many months of proffesional experience either in the format
                                of an internship or as junior engineer. I have joined firms that undertook exclusively international projects,  working both as  a part of a team but also handling many responsibilities independently. Some of my responsibilities so far include
                                but are not limited to: <li>Static Calculations</li>
                                <li>Construction Drawings</li>
                                <li>BIM Modelling using Revit Autodesk, Tekla Structures</li>
                                <li>Quality Assesment of Constructions Drawings</li>

                                <p>Still a newbie in Development, at least in the web, I am just starting to explore the infinite possibilities in this
                                field.Although I have written code to automate my workflow as an engineer,for a while now I have started to experiment with Web development projects
                                as well. With a few online courses under my belt, I am looking to take on assignments that can help me
                                progressively advance my skills both in Front as well as in Back-End web development!!</p>
